My Resolution For 2022

1. Be a freelance developer (almost there)
2. Be good at programming (somewhat good)
3. Go to university if possible (SNMPTN BROOO, uin sih tapi wkwkk)
4. Make my parents happy (still a disappoinment)
5. be strong (not quite there)
6. drink water (yep)
7. eat more meat (a literal carnivore now)
8. go outside (i even talk to people now)
