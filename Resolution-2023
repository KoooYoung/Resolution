My Resolution For 2023

1. make money through coding (done)
2. pay my own college tuition fee (done)
3. master javascript and typescript (somewhat comfortable in js and ts now)
4. make coding tutorials on youtube (not there yet)
5. be strong and fit (not there yet)
6. make my parents happy (maybeðŸ¤”)
